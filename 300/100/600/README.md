# 600 - Start the Development Server

Now that you have set up your ticker tape component, you can start the development server to see it in action.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ cd ticker_tape
$ npm run build
$ npm start # TO DO: Currently won't return the page well
```

This will start the React app, and you should see your ticker tape component displaying the messages you provided.
